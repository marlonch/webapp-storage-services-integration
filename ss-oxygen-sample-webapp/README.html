  <h1>The webapp main module</h1>

  <p>Starting with version 16.0, oXygen can be deployed sever-side,
    as a web application. The editing logic is kept on the server, while
    the document UI is delivered to the browser using HTML5 and JQuery.</p>

  <p>This project is a customization example that uses the oxygen-sdk and which allows the user edit
      DITA files located on Google Drive or Dropbox. This integrations handle usual problems that
      may occur when integrating the webapp with a CMS, such as: file access, user authentication
      and authorization, security, etc.</p>

  <p>The general pattern is to provide the Java code as an oXygen
    plugin which is loaded by the webapp at startup, and to add
    integration specific Servlets and HTML pages to the webapp by
    editing the web.xml file.</p>

  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>
    First of all, the main configuration file is the <a
      href="src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml">src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</a>
    file. Here we bind the oXygen Author servlets and filters as well as
    the plugins servlets and filters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important file that needs to be placed in the <b>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</b>folder
    is the <b>license.txt</b> file. This file entitles you to use the
    oXygen Author WebApp. In order to obtain such a license, contact us
    on <a href="mailto:support@oxygenxml.com">support@oxygenxml.com</a>.
